#1404 Images

We asked you to take images of 1404 Siebel at the end of the VR Microlesson. We're going to use these images to reconstruct 1404 in 3D using these images during our Computer Vision lesson.

In order to do this, we need these images and we'd like for you to upload them here.
Please follow these instructions to get the images to us :smile: :

1. Clone this repository using ```git clone https://github.com/CS196Illinois/1404-images.git```

2. Add your images to the ```flash``` and ```no-flash``` folders. The first picture goes in the ```no-flash``` folder and the second one (the one taken with the flash turned on) goes in the ```flash``` folder. Your images should be called ```YourNetid.jpg```.

3. Commit your changes ```git commit -m "images added by NETID"```

4. Push your changes ```git pull && git push```

###Warning :bowtie:
We may decide to use this as attendence for Week 11's lecture as we know quite a few people like to spoof their attendence.
